Thanks Hagiwo! I hope my additions are pleasing. 

A BOM update has been added to reflect use of LM40405.0 reference shunt instead of lm40412. This change was a necessary correction due to using renamed component packages in eagle. 8-24-23
This change was also updated in the bottom bom CSV files and schematic.
